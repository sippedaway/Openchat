# [Openchat](https://chat.sipped.org/)
**Openchat** is a completely open-source website with one chat room that anyone can talk in. No rules. No accounts. Completely anonymous, unless you change your username. Wanna impersonate someone? Sure. Wanna cuss at someone? Sure.

## Well isn't that a bad idea?
**Probably is.** That's the fun. Anarchyyyy

## Does it look nice?
It looks modern and really cool. Customizable features. Customize themes, message formats, font size and uh that's about it. Better than Discord I'd say.

![Cool design am I right](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sippedaway/Openchat/refs/heads/main/public/github_image.png)

## That's it? Just a chatbox?
Yes.

## Version
#### 1.0
- **Release date:** 02-18-25

## Legal
Openchat is a hobby project. It probably will get DDoS'd or something. I couldn't care less. It's nothing serious.
